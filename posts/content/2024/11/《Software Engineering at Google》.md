# Software Engineering at Google

1. 软件工程和编程不同，简单的编程周期短，软件工程周期长，需要寻求更长久的发展方式。因此是工程化。编程作为工程的技术核心，单并不全是编程，还

2. Google组织的是一个复杂的工程化的系统，首要任务是要保持整体的稳定性和可持续性。这也是工程问题的核心。对于工程问题相较于编程问题，

*Human costs are not the only finite resource that needs to scale. Just as software itself needs to scale well with traditional resources such as compute, memory, storage, and bandwidth, the development of that software also needs to scale, both in terms of human time involvement and the compute resources that power your development workflow. If the compute cost for your test cluster grows superlinearly, consuming more compute resources per person each quarter, you’re on an unsustainable path and need to make changes soon.*

3. 权衡和成本
- 记号笔的例子：
*In many organizations, whiteboard markers are treated as precious goods. They are tightly controlled and always in short supply. Invariably, half of the markers at any given whiteboard are dry and unusable. How often have you been in a meeting that was disrupted by lack of a working marker? How often have you had your train of thought derailed by a marker running out? How often have all the markers just gone missing, presumably because some other team ran out of markers and had to abscond with yours? All for a product that costs less than a dollar.*

*Google tends to have unlocked closets full of office supplies, including whiteboard markers, in most work areas. With a moment’s notice it is easy to grab dozens of markers in a variety of colors. Somewhere along the line we made an explicit trade- off: it is far more important to optimize for obstacle-free brainstorming than to protect against someone wandering off with a bunch of markers.*
 
**In the end, decisions in an engineering group should come down to very few things:**

**We are doing this because we must (legal requirements, customer requirements).**

**We are doing this because it is the best option (as determined by some appropriate decider) we can see at the time, based on current evidence.**

我们的目标是对我们所做的每件事都有同样程度的关注和明确的成本/收益权衡，从办公用品和员工津贴到开发者的日常体验，再到如何提供和运行全球规模的服务。我们经常说，“谷歌是一家数据驱动的公司。”事实上，这很简单：即使没有数据，也会有证据、先例和论据。做出好的工程决策就是权衡所有可用的输入，并就权衡做出明智的决策。有时，这些决策是基于本能或公认的最佳实践，但仅是一种假设之后，我们用尽了各种方法来衡量或估计真正的潜在成本。

**二. 如何融入团队**
1. 团队产生的能量，要比一个人闭门造车要好的多，要确保自己的idea，不被其他人窃取，也就是说，要有自己核心的团队。这样既能避免闭门造车，又可以确保真正团队合作，避免其他的问题。

2. 工程师们的环境，最好是4-8个人一个封闭环境，这样既能保证团队合作，又可以尽量避免闭门造车。

**软件工程是一个团队的努力**

*So, what “hiding” boils down to is this: working alone is inherently riskier than working with others. Even though you might be afraid of someone stealing your idea or thinking you’re not intelligent, you should be much more concerned about wasting huge swaths of your time toiling away on the wrong thing.*

*Don’t become another statistic.*
